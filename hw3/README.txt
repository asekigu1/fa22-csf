Part b:
For part (b), youâ€™ll use the memory traces as well as your simulator to 
determine which cache configuration has the best overall effectiveness. 
You should take a variety of properties into account: hit rates, 
miss penalties, total cache size (including overhead), etc. 

In your README.txt, describe in detail what experiments you ran (and why!),
 what results you got (and how!), and what, in your opinion, 
 is the best cache configuration of them all.
